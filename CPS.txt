A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a system that integrates computing (cyber) and physical processes.

Definition:

A CPS is an engineered system where software, computation, and communication tightly interact with physical components (like machines, sensors, and actuators) in real time.


maybe smart watch is very simple example

üîπ Why it is CPS-like

A smartwatch has:

Physical components ‚Üí sensors (heart rate, accelerometer, GPS), display, buttons.

Cyber components ‚Üí software apps, processing unit, communication with phone or cloud.

Real-time interaction ‚Üí it constantly monitors your heart rate, steps, or notifications and reacts immediately (vibration alerts, display updates).

The word ‚Äúsynergic‚Äù comes from synergy.

Synergy = when two or more things work together and produce a result that is greater than the sum of their individual effects.

Synergic = describes actions, processes, or systems that work cooperatively to enhance each other‚Äôs performance.

üîπ In CPS / Engineering Context

Synergic often describes how physical and cyber components collaborate.

Example:

Sensors + computation + actuators working together synergically produce smarter, faster, or more reliable outcomes.

In smart manufacturing, robots + IoT sensors + cloud analytics = synergic system.


üîπ Why a self-automatic system can be CPS

A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) requires:

Physical components ‚Üí machines, sensors, actuators

Cyber components ‚Üí software, computation, control algorithms

Real-time interaction ‚Üí continuous sensing, computation, and actuation

Feedback loops ‚Üí decisions affect the physical world, which is then sensed again

Interconnectivity refers to the state or condition of being connected with each other, especially in systems, networks, or devices. It emphasizes the ability of multiple components to communicate, exchange data, and work together.

üîπ General Meaning

Interconnectivity = connection + communication

Components are linked so that information or control can flow between them.

Example in daily life:

Your smartphone, smartwatch, and laptop are interconnected via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

‚úÖ1.PARADIGM OF CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
üìë Summary: Paradigm of Cyber-Physical Systems

The word paradigm has two modern uses:
	A worldview: shapes how knowledge evolves, what questions are asked, and how answers are found.
	A foundational model: a mental or constitutional pattern that underpins all systems and artifacts.
	In this paper, the authors mainly use the second meaning, but acknowledge it is linked to the first.

CPS Paradigm
	The paradigm of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) can be understood through three core elements:
		Generic system architecture ‚Äì the common structural model of CPS.
		Enabling knowledge and technology assets ‚Äì the scientific and technological resources that make CPS possible.
		Distinguishing system characteristics ‚Äì the unique features that separate CPS from other systems.

Purpose of the Paradigm
	Helps define the essential components of CPS without listing all possible examples.
	Provides a way to manage complexity and impose order.
	Guides what belongs to CPS and what does not.

Current State of CPS Discipline
	The field has advanced to the stage where the distinguishing characteristics of CPS are already defined.
	These characteristics are discussed in the next subsection (1.2)

‚úÖ In short:
The paradigm of CPS is the underlying model that defines CPS in terms of its architecture, enabling technologies, and unique characteristics. It helps manage complexity and determine what belongs to CPS as a discipline.




üìëSummary:1.1 From the Standard Model to a Synergic Model

Standard Model of CPS
	CPS emerged from the merging of physical systems and ICCT (Information, Communication, and Computing Technologies).
	CPS are in constant interaction with their environment (technical, social, economic) and with humans/communities.
	The generic system architecture (standard model) sees CPS as:
		Cyber components: discrete, logical, switched ‚Üí handle computation, communication, and control.
		Physical components: continuous-time processes ‚Üí transform energy and materials, governed by natural laws.

Traditionally, technologies are separated as cyber technologies or physical technologies.

Limitations of the Standard Model
	It treats cyber and physical as separate but connected parts, not as a holistic unity.
	CPS, however, is meant to be holistic, where cyber and physical are inseparable.
	Advances in:
		Theories: complex systems science, self-X systems (self-organizing, self-healing, etc.).
		Technologies: miniaturization, new computational principles.

	These advancements push researchers to go beyond the standard model.

Toward a Synergic Model
	Trends in computing (data processing, storage, miniaturization) are making the gap between atoms (physical) and bits (cyber) smaller.
	In the near future, the boundaries between cyber and physical subsystems will blur.
	The authors propose a synergic model, where:
		Cyber and physical technologies are no longer separate.
		A new category: synergic technologies emerges.
		These technologies act as the coupling layer between purely cyber and purely physical technologies.

Key Point

Synergic technologies are developing faster than cyber or physical alone.
This model better represents ongoing integration and is used to classify the implementation-enabling technologies of CPS (discussed later in the paper).

‚úÖ In short:
The standard model views CPS as separate cyber + physical parts working together. The synergic model sees them merging into one unified system, enabled by emerging synergic technologies, which blur the line between atoms and bits.

üìë Summary: 1.2 Distinguishing Characteristics of CPS (C1‚ÄìC16)

The CPS paradigm implies unique features that separate CPS from traditional systems.
Here are the main characteristics:

C1 ‚Äì Human-Centered Support
    CPS are designed to support human activities, well-being, and problem-solving in cooperation with their environment.

C2 ‚Äì Openness
    CPS are functionally and structurally open systems, with blurred system boundaries.

C3 ‚Äì Dynamic Adaptation
    CPS can change their boundaries and behavior dynamically, reorganize, and reconfigure themselves.

C4 ‚Äì Dual Nature (Cyber + Physical)
    CPS consist of a digital cyber-part and an analog physical-part, designed to work together in synergy.

C5 ‚Äì Heterogeneity
    CPS are heterogeneous, built from diverse components that may join/leave at any time, sometimes facing conflicts with other systems.

C6 ‚Äì Multiscale Operation
    CPS function across extreme spatial scales (nano ‚Üí global) and temporal ranges (instantaneous ‚Üí long-term).

C7 ‚Äì Hybrid Components
    Components encapsulate both physical (material) and cyber (software, knowledge) entities, providing real-time processing.

C8 ‚Äì Flexible Connectivity
    Components can have predefined or ad-hoc functional connections at multiple levels.

C9 ‚Äì Multiple Problem-Solving Strategies
    Components may use different strategies/plans to achieve the overall system objective.

C10 ‚Äì Knowledge-Intensive Components
    Components handle:
        Built-in knowledge (programmed),
        Sensor-derived knowledge,
        Knowledge generated by reasoning & learning.

C11 ‚Äì Context-Aware Decision Making
    Components make situated decisions, using causal and procedural reasoning in a context-dependent way.

C12 ‚Äì Learning Capability
    Components can memorize, learn from history, adapt in an unsupervised way, and specialize using smart agents and emergent intelligence.

C13 ‚Äì Self-Reorganization & Proactivity
    Components can reorganize in response to unpredictable events and act proactively beyond pre-planned functions.

C14 ‚Äì Distributed Decision-Making
    CPS decisions are distributed among many components, using multi-criteria optimization and reflexive interactions.

C15 ‚Äì Resource & Security Management
    Advanced strategies are applied to ensure resource management, security, integrity, and reliability.

C16 ‚Äì Next-Generation CPS
    Future CPS (molecular, bio-computing based) may exhibit reproductive intelligence ‚Äî i.e., some ability to self-reproduce or evolve.

üîë Key Takeaway

Not all CPS will display all 16 characteristics equally.
The paradigm defines an ideal profile of CPS.
A profile diagram (as shown in the paper) can indicate how strongly a given CPS instance realizes these characteristics.

‚úÖ In short: CPS are human-centered, open, adaptive, hybrid, multi-scale, knowledge-driven, learning, and distributed systems with strong emphasis on security, reliability, and future intelligence.

‚úÖ5. IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES

Implementation Principles of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) ‚Äì Summary
CPSs operate differently from traditional engineering and ICT systems, requiring specific implementation principles for effective design, control, and integration.

Systemic (Holistic) Interconnections
    Cyber and physical components must operate synergistically, not just connected via simple interfaces.
    Physical-to-Cyber (P2C): Sensors convert physical phenomena into digital signals.
    Cyber-to-Physical (C2P): Actuators convert digital signals into physical effects.
    Future interfaces (transponders/transducers) will enable more integrated, atom-to-bit interactions.
    Challenge: Interfacing components across multi-scale CPSs remains complex.

Model-Driven Specification
    CPSs have complex, multi-scale physical and system-level requirements (safety, security, latency, fault tolerance).
    Complexity grows with functionality, heterogeneity, and structure; classical divide-and-conquer design fails.
    Solution: Use multi-level abstraction and model-based design:
        Abstraction models ‚Äì conceptualization
        Formal models ‚Äì rigorous specification
        Executable models ‚Äì simulation/testing
        Performance models ‚Äì benchmarking and prediction
Supports holistic (top-down) and incremental (bottom-up) system integration.

Platform-Based Development
    CPS development requires integrated platforms combining software, hardware, networks, firmware, and knowledge resources.
    Example: AUTOSAR in automotive industry.
    A composition platform synchronizes sub-platforms to enable interoperability across nano-, micro-, macro-, and mega-scale systems.

Component-Based Implementation
    Components are modular, reusable units of system functionality.
    Key concepts:
        Compositionality: System properties emerge from component properties.
        Composability: Components function reliably despite interactions with others.
    Combines with platform-based development for holistic design.

Real-Time Computation
    CPSs must process and manage data in real time, both within and across components.
    Relies on embedded processors, cloud, grid, or cluster computing.
    Real-world constraints (physical coupling, delays) mean CPSs often use quasi-real-time optimization.

Event-Oriented Control
    CPSs combine time-triggered and event-triggered dynamics.
    Global behavior emerges from local interactions, not centralized control.
    Requires adaptive, context-sensitive control across multiple time scales.
    Two-phase control:
        Event detection
        Event handling
    Works well with service-oriented and distributed systems.

Service-Oriented Functionality (SOA)
    Focus on services instead of components; services are independent, interoperable units.
    Can be combined, reused, or accessed remotely (e.g., web services via WSDL/SOAP).
    Facilitates modular and scalable CPS architectures.

Minimal Intrusiveness
    CPSs interact with humans and the environment; should adapt to changing users and contexts.
    Challenges include cognitive mismatches and intrusiveness.
    Techniques like agent-based smartness and tele-operation can reduce human/environmental intrusion.
    Understanding human perception, cognition, and cooperation is essential for effective integration.

Key Takeaways:
CPS implementation requires holistic integration, model-driven design, component- and platform-based development, real-time event control, service orientation, and human-aware minimal intrusion, addressing the unique complexity and multi-scale nature of these systems.

Manufacturing Analytics is the process of using data from manufacturing operations to understand, predict, and improve production performance.

# Descriptive Analytics: What is happening now?
    Monitors production in real-time.

    Examples: machine utilization, defect rates, energy consumption.

# Predictive Analytics: What might happen next?
    Uses historical data and machine learning to forecast problems.

    Examples: predicting equipment failures, production delays, or quality issues.

# Prescriptive Analytics: What should we do?
    Suggests actions to optimize production.

    Examples: adjusting machine parameters automatically, scheduling maintenance, or reallocating resources.

# Tools used in Manufacturing Analytics:
    Machine Learning models: SVM, Decision Trees, Regression, Bayesian models.

    Big Data platforms: Hadoop, Spark.

    Visualization tools: Tableau, Power BI.

# Why it’s important:
    Improves efficiency, quality, and safety.

    Reduces downtime and costs.

    Supports smart, data-driven decision-making in manufacturing.

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the use of connected sensors, machines, and devices in industrial settings to collect, exchange, and analyze data in real-time, enabling smarter and more efficient operations.

# Sensors and Devices: Measure things like temperature, vibration, pressure, speed, or chemical composition in machines or processes.

# Connectivity: Sensors and machines are connected via industrial networks like Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or protocols like OPC UA to transmit data.

#Data Collection & Storage: Data is sent to databases, cloud platforms, or distributed systems for storage and processing.

# Integration with Analytics: The collected data can be analyzed to monitor performance, predict failures, optimize production, or make decisions.

# Key Features of IIoT:
    Real-time monitoring of machines and processes.

    Predictive maintenance and reduced downtime.

    Automation through actuators based on data insights.

    Enhanced operational efficiency and safety.

Manufacturing Analytics + IIoT → Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)

1. Physical Layer (Machines & Sensors)
    Machines do the work.

    Sensors measure things like temperature, vibration, pressure, and speed.

    Actuators can adjust the machines automatically.

2. IIoT / Connectivity Layer
    Collects data from machines and sensors in real-time.

    Sends data over networks (Ethernet, Wi-Fi).

    Stores data in databases (cloud or on-site).

3. Analytics Layer (Manufacturing Analytics)
    Descriptive: Shows what’s happening right now.

    Predictive: Forecasts future problems like machine failure.

    Prescriptive: Suggests what to do to improve production.

    Uses tools like machine learning models.

4. Feedback & Control
    Actuators automatically adjust machines.

    Sends alerts to operators.

    Optimizes production in real-time.

5. Visualization & Decision Support
    Dashboards show data clearly (Tableau, Power BI).

    Engineers make better decisions and analyze problems.
